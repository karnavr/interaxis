            <p>Physics is about the world we live in. We understand it first by interacting—touching, throwing, breaking things, watching how they move. But as we learn more, the interaction fades. Equations replace intuition. Problems become symbols on a page instead of things we can see and feel. </p> 

            <p>This is a mistake. Models are meant to describe the real world, but without a connection to experience, they feel arbitrary. The best way to learn is to play—to change things, push on them, break them, see what happens, and ask why. </p> 
            
            <p>Physics education should not just be about solving for \( x \). It should be about understanding *why the equation looks like that in the first place*. What assumptions went into it? What happens if you violate them? What happens when you tweak a variable that wasn’t in the original problem? </p> 
            
            <p>Somewhere between hands-on experience and abstract mathematics, there's a space where intuition meets theory. That's where learning happens.</p>
